Font rendering:
  [X] Rectangle packing
  [ ] Rendering diacritics -- Norwegian, Russian etc.
  [ ] Make them look better when scaled up/down
  [ ] (optional/maybe) Eventually move on from FreeType and roll something custom? (or use dwrite but it's a pain to use)

Rendering:
  [~] Lines and rotated quads
  [ ] 'Scissors' regions
  [ ] Different 'cameras' depending on rendering ctx
