Font rendering:
  [X] Rectangle packing
  [ ] Rendering diacritics -- Norwegian, Russian etc.
  [ ] Make them look better when scaled up/down
  [ ] (optional/maybe) Eventually move on from FreeType and roll something custom? (or use dwrite but it's a pain to use)
  [ ] Unifying font and render to be the same module(?)

Rendering:
  [~] Lines and rotated quads
  [ ] 'Scissors' regions
  [ ] Different 'cameras' depending on rendering ctx

String:
 [ ] String16 for 'better' windows API interop
 [ ] UTF8 and UTF16 decode/encode

GFX:
 [ ] win32_arena seems kinda weird, maybe gfx layer should have its own arena, or some other way to initialize/assign an arena
