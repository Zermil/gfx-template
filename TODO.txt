GFX:
  [ ] global win32_event_list should be a hash-table-like-thing?

Font rendering:
  [X] Rectangle packing
  [ ] When you specify where to render text (x; y) it is relative to bottom-left of the entire quad-batch instead of the expected top-left
  [ ] Rendering diacritics -- Norwegian, Russian etc.
  [ ] Make glyphs look better when scaled up/down
  [ ] (optional/maybe) Eventually move on from FreeType and roll something custom? (or use DWrite but it's a pain to use)
  [ ] Unifying font and render to be the same module(?)
  [ ] Font context when we have more than one font backend  

Rendering:
  [~] Lines and rotated quads
  [ ] 'Scissors' regions
  [ ] Different 'cameras' depending on rendering ctx
  [ ] Omit texture so we can render regular quads AND texture in the same batch

String:
  [ ] String16 for 'better' windows API interop
  [ ] UTF8/16/32 decode/encode
